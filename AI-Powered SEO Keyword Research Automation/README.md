## Introduction

This n8n workflow automates SEO keyword research using AI and data-driven analytics. It combines OpenAI's language models with DataForSEO's analytics to generate comprehensive keyword strategies for content creation. The workflow is triggered by a webhook from NocoDB, processes the input data through multiple stages, and returns a detailed content brief with optimized keywords.

## Workflow Architecture

The workflow follows a structured process:

1. **Input Collection**: Receives data via webhook from NocoDB
2. **Topic Expansion**: Generates keywords using AI
3. **Keyword Metrics Analysis**: Gathers search volume, CPC, and difficulty metrics
4. **Competitor Analysis**: Analyzes competitor content for ranking keywords
5. **Final Strategy Creation**: Combines all data to generate a comprehensive keyword strategy
6. **Output Storage**: Saves results back to NocoDB and sends notifications
